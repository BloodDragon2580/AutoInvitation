This addon, searches for these characters in the chat: "+" or "inv".
Players who write the characters in the chat are automatically invited by the addon into a group.
This is useful for example for events, attacks or the like where you would have to invite several players.

You just have to create 2 macros:

"/ai"

The first one turns the addon on / off and starts the player invitations.
and

"/ai1"

The second macro continues to search for players when the group should be full. For example, if you change to a raid.
